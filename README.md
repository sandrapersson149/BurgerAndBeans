# 🍔 Burgers and Beans
A fictional webpage for a restaurant - Burgers and beans. They sell burgers and I guess beans as well... 🤷

This is just because I wanted to make a simple page and try out some new things.

## Trying new things
I have used Framer motion animations and used Google maps api for a map on the contact page.
